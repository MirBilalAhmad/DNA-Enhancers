***Enhancer Identification with a Multi-Classifier Stacked Ensemble Model***
**Enhancer identification with a multi-classifier stacked ensemble model is a machine-learning approach used to predict and distinguish genomic regions known as enhancers. Enhancers are regulatory elements in DNA that play a crucial role in controlling gene expression and cell identity. Identifying enhancers is essential for understanding gene regulation and the underlying mechanisms that govern various cellular processes.**



First, run Create_feature_Descriptors.ipynb file to generate features of both the training and testing dataset.


Next, Run the Models_Training.ipynb file and save the best parameters of every classifier.


Finally, Run Models_Testing.ipynb file to see the results.
